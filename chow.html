            <h1>Chow.</h1>
            <h3>November 2020</h3>
            <p>Chow. is a project I made for my human-computer interaction course. One of the labs for that course was
                to put together a prototype of a food delivery app using Figma. It was primarily focused on the
                interactive aspects of creating a prototype, as well as applying the HCI concepts we learned in class to
                create a
                easy and comfortable user experience. However, I
                had a lot of fun with the visual design as well. </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/chow-thumbnail.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Through this project, I learned a few things about Figma that I didn't know before hand, mostly about how
                to create more interactive prototypes. For example, implementing both horizontal and vertical scrolling
                elements within a frame, swapping elements vs. using overlays, and more.</p>
            <h2>Nielsen's "Who-ri-sticks"?</h2>
            <p>For this project we also had to point out some examples of Nielsen's Heuristics within our app prototypes
                to prove that we, ya know, actually learned something. Certain things such as consistency, affordances,
                flexibility of navigation options, visibility of elements, error prevention, etc. were all
                considerations that I made while designing the app and prototype.</p>

                    <p>This little pop-out menu provides the user with quickly accessible navigation options. It's also
                        interactive in the Figma prototype!</p>

                <p>This prototype was created entirely using Figma. Check out the full demo <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Hr5rX4OO0XHHLUCz4rpZHQ/Lab-2?node-id=1%3A35&scaling=scale-down">here</a>.</p>
