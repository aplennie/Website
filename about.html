            <h1>Who dis?</h1>
            <p>My name is Alina, but you can call me Lennie! I created this website to showcase some of the work I've
                done. You'll mostly find website/app mockups and some writeup to go along with them. Enjoy and take your
                time! <em>P.S.</em> If you wanna get in touch, there's some contact info below!</p>
            <div class="caption-box" id="fact">
                <p><em class="b">Fun Fact! </em>This website went through about 4 iterations, all of which I absolutely hated! How
                    long until I hate this design too? Who knows!</p>

            <h2>A lil' bout me</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™ve been a creative person for as long as I can remember, and its taken 4 painful years in an
                engineering program to make me realize that I need to express it! It's always been my dream to become a
                designer, to me it never really mattered what kind, as long as I could have the opportunity to bring my
                ideas to life. I'd love it if my future career made use of my creative skills. <br><br> What are those
                skills, you ask? Well, there's: </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="pill-box">HTML + CSS</li>
                <li class="pill-box">Figma</li>
                <li class="pill-box">Some JavaScript</li>
                <li class="pill-box">Adobe XD</li>
                <li class="pill-box">Adobe Illustrator</li>
                <li class="pill-box">Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <li class="pill-box">SketchUp</li>
                <li class="pill-box">AutoCAD</li>
                <li class="pill-box">Some Python</li>
                <li class="pill-box">MS Office <em class="b">(wow)</em></li>

            </ul>
            <p>I'm always trying to add to this list! Lately I've been wanting to learn video editing as well as cool
                programs like Adobe After Effects. <br><br> I recently completed an online UI/UX course through Coursera
                (taught by Calarts), which helped give me a general overview of what UI/UX design is, and the process of
                designing a website or app from start to finish. I really enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to signing
                up for Google's UX Certificate when that becomes available.</p>
