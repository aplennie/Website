            <h1>Amazon, But Make It User-Friendly</h1>
            <h3>August 2020</h3>
            <p>There are many things which just make sense in this world, even amidst all the chaos we’re currently
                living through. To give you some simple examples: If you knock over a full cup of water, it will spill.
                If
                you close your eyes, you won’t see anything. If you stub your toe, it will hurt.</p>
            <p>The Amazon website is not one of these things — at least from a UX perspective.</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-1-alt.PNG" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>This gem was found on the product page for a mouse pad. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/ask/questions/Tx1ANQ8ZCCU783B/ref=ask_dp_dpmw_al_hza">I'm not lying</a>.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>There is so much “gunk” on Amazon’s website, which I assume was added to give users more pathways for
                finding items, but probably primarily to maximize the number of products they see on a single page...
                leading them to <em>buy more stuff</em>. </p>
            <p>My goal here is not to make users <em>buy more stuff</em>, but to make the experience a little bit
                cleaner and easier for them, which is why Amazon and I could probably never be friends IRL. Sorry, Jeff.
            </p>
            <h2>Things that just <em>make sense</em></h2>
            <p>Let’s take a look at the home page. Immediately, we can see Amazon is trying to throw random crap at us.
                A wireless sound bar? I’m sure it’ll pair amazingly with my 10 year old TV with no wireless capability.
                <em> Add to cart.</em> </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-4.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>Home sweet home.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We can also see the categories are hidden away in a hamburger menu, which I’ll admit, I never cared about
                until now since I always use the search bar. Regardless, Amazon should be focused on helping the user
                find what
                they need, not selling them on things they don’t.</p>
            <p>I redesigned this page mostly by cleaning up the UI and reorganizing the categories (I really did go
                through <em>every single</em> category, folks).</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-home.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>Almost seems real, doesn't it?</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I tried to cut down the categories in a way that just made sense. I started by grouping all the Amazon
                products and services at the top of the list and added familiar app icons to link users to services such
                as Prime Video. <br> As for the navbar, I removed that secondary navbar to free up some real estate as I
                didn't see much use for it. I also cut out the "Returns and Orders" and "Prime" links as those are under
                "Your Account" anyways. Finally, I made sure the navbar was fixed when scrolling — which it should've
                been in
                the first place! </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-5.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This account dropdown is interesting. Most of the links are useful but they can already be accessed by
                going onto the main account page so I decided to trim them down only the most necessary. Links like
                "Register for a Business Account" aren't used as often so they don't have to be in this menu. </p>
            <h2>Grab a seat</h2>
            <p>I’ll be honest, as much as I hate this fact, I am an avid Amazon shopper. You probably are too. (If
                you’re not, give yourself a pat on the back for not supporting shady monopolistic business practices).
                So tell me, how many times have you used Amazon’s Subscribe and Save? For me, that’s zero times. Okay, I
                get it might be useful for, like, toothpaste. Let me ask you this then: how many times have you used
                Subscribe and Save for purchasing chairs? Unless you’re literally burning through chairs by using them
                as fuel for your fireplace... I can’t see the use of this option here, it just leads the user to <em>buy
                    more
                    stuff</em>.</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-6.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>Ah yes, finally an option for my competitive sitting hobby.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Let's say the user is looking for a new dining chair. If they know what a searchbar is — which I'm
                assuming they do, they simply type in "dining chair." If for some strange reason they have never
                encountered a searchbar in their life — or more realistically, they are not able to type — they can use
                the category links to lead them to the dining chair category.</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-searchres.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>They can now filter their search even further by using a few *simplified* options. Price filtering has
                been changed to a simple slider, and review filtering has been condensed into one line of stars. Another
                interesting inconsistency I noticed throughout Amazon's search pages is how the results are displayed.
                On some pages, they are displayed in a tile format, however on others they are more of a one product per
                line view. Why not give the user a view option akin to the one found on most e-commerce sites? </p>
            <p>Let's move on to the juicy stuff: the product page.</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-prod.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The user has found a chair they like (pretty swanky if I do say so myself). At a glance, they can see the
                product rating, details, and images. To the right we have all the purchase info such as the price and
                Add to Cart/Wishlist buttons. Under that is a special <em>"oopsie-proof"</em> Buy Now option to replace
                the
                1-Click Buy. Users can interact only by sliding so that they don't end up accidentally buying that
                pricey chair with their partner's account. That's not even the coolest part, get this — this little
                section is sticky as the user scrolls!
            </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-scroll.gif" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The user can then check out the reviews, and Add to Cart without having to scroll back to the top of the
                page! </p>
            <h2>Checking out</h2>
            <p>At this point, the user is ready to drop some cash on a new chair or two. So here's the revamped Shopping
                Cart, featuring fresh UI and more options for organizing items and moving them to the Wishlist or Save
                for Later. </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-checkout.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The rest of the checkout process is pretty straightforward, so I'll end the journey here. There's still
                hundreds of pages and elements
                throughout Amazon’s website which are a little questionable, but I hope this small collection of
                redesigned pages proved how Amazon could be so much more user-friendly if they tried. It's too bad their
                primary goal is to get us to <em>buy more stuff</em>.
