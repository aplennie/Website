            <h1>Amazon, But Make It User-Friendly</h1>
            <h3>August 2020</h3>
            <p>There are many things which just make sense in this world, even during the chaotic era we’re currently
                living in. To give you some simple examples: If you knock over a full cup of water, it will spill. If
                you close your eyes, you won’t see anything. If you stub your toe, it will hurt.</p>
            <p>The Amazon website is not one of these things (at least from a UX perspective).</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-1-alt.PNG" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>This gem was found on the product page for a mouse pad. I'm not lying.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>There is so much “gunk” on Amazon’s website, which I assume was added to give users more pathways for
                finding items, but probably primarily to maximize the number of products they see on a single page...
                leading them to <em>buy more stuff</em>. </p>
            <p>My goal here is not to make users <em>buy more stuff</em>, but to make the experience a little bit
                cleaner and easier for them, which is why Amazon and I could probably never be friends IRL. Sorry, Jeff.
            </p>
            <h2>New and Improved</h2>
            <p>Let’s take a look at the home page. Immediately, we can see Amazon is trying to throw random crap at us.
                A Wireless sound bar? I’m sure it’ll pair amazingly with my 10 year old TV with no wireless capability.
                Add to cart. </p>

                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/amazon-4.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>If you want me to sign up for Prime Video, pick something other than Rambo: Last Blood for the ads.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We can also see the categories are hidden away in a hamburger menu, which I’ll admit, I never cared about
                until now since I always use the search bar. Regardless, Amazon should be focused on helping the user find what
                they need, not selling them on things they don’t.</p>
            <p>I redesigned this page mostly by cleaning up the UI and reorganizing the categories (I really did go through <em>every single</em> category, folks).</p>
