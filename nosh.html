            <h1>Food for thought - nosh. mockups</h1>
            <h3>Jul 2020</h3>
            <p>This was the first project I worked on just for fun. Interestingly enough, the whole thing started from
                just the word: nosh. I just really like the word nosh. It‚Äôs satisfying and perfectly describes the act
                of chewing on some really yummy food. I thought the word was fresh and edgy, so it would be a perfect
                fit for a brand or network that was targeted at a more ‚Äòfresh‚Äô and youthful audience. </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/nosh-thumbnail.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I took some inspiration from the Bon Appetit site and brand (before it all kinda fell apart due to the
                racism scandals... <em>oof.</em>) because I liked how simple it was compared to a lot of other recipe
                sites. The menu has only a few links leading to the recipes, videos, the blog (podcast in their case),
                and the shop.</p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/ba-example.PNG" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="caption-box" id="img-caption">
                    <p>A few links I wanted to focus on. Also note: They're really trying to salvage what's left of
                        their reputation...</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Breaking down the design</h2>
            <p>You‚Äôll probably notice the first thing on each page - besides the navbar - is the jumbotron for
                showcasing the latest content and stories. The user can then scroll or filter through the rest of the
                content as they wish. </p>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/nosh-videos.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The recipes page in particular is different because the main purpose it serves is helping the user find a
                recipe. The hierarchy goes as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If the user has an idea of what they want to make, they can just use the searchbar.</li>
                <li>If they don‚Äôt exactly know, they can get a helping hand by filtering by the meal (breakfast, lunch,
                    etc) and the type (healthy, keto, etc)</li>
                <li>If they really don‚Äôt know, the next option is just for them to scroll through all the recipes until
                    they see something they like. The full-on hand-holding option, if you will.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="img-block">
                <div class="img-block-img">
                    <img src="/images/nosh-recipes.png" alt="">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>A fresh coat of paint</h2>
            <p>The visual design is probably my favourite thing about the whole concept. It‚Äôs pretty experimental for me
                since I rarely use thick stroke lines around elements, but I enjoy the blocky minimalistic look. I guess
                it‚Äôs not exactly a popular design scheme since nowadays its common to use a more ‚Äúsoft‚Äù look with
                rounded corners and gradients. Yes it's true, I'm just not like other girls üôÑ</p>
            <p>The colour scheme is simple, with greys/whites and a bold accent yellow (or chartreuse? I don‚Äôt know what
                to call it). I'm not a huge fan of using pure black and pure white so you‚Äôll notice I used ‚Äúmuted‚Äù black
                (aka
                dark grey) for the text, as well as for the dark mode background. Also check out those hex codes - easy
                to remember üòè</p>
