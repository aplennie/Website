            <h1>Scribenote</h1>
            <h3>Ongoing</h3>
            <p>This is a project of a friend of mine that I've been helping out with. Scribenote is online medical
                scribe
                software that is capable of documenting, storing, and categorizing recorded appointment audio and data
                in just a few clicks. He wanted to completely overhaul the front-end of the application, and he kindly
                asked me to help out using my design *expertise* :) </p>

            <h2>The Homepage</h2>
            <p>We wanted it to be simple and to-the-point. Initially, the user is presented with an attention-grabbing
                headline and some cool art (We plan to replace this with an animation of some sort). Then, there's a
                call to action to lead the user into the next section, in which the user can watch an intro video to get
                a grasp of what Scribenote is about. The next sections act as an additional "pitch" to the user,
                followed by a larger, more evident call-to-action. </p>

            <h2>Our New Savior?</h2>
            <p>Both of us had heard of Webflow, the visual coding tool. My friend though it would be a great tool to try
                to use to minimize the amount of effort needed to maintain the website's front-end. I just thought it
                would be cool to learn! So, we decided to get started and try to implement Scribenote's facelift using
                Webflow instead of React.</p>
            <p>Initially, there was a bit of a learning curve (as with almost all new tools) but I got into the hang of
                things pretty quickly. I managed to get the site homepage looking spot-on compared to the Figma
                prototype in just about a day of fidgeting. One thing I love is how easy it is to set up different
                viewport breakpoints to make the site responsive on all devices. Goodbye media queries!</p>
            <p>I've still got more to learn, especially when it comes to
                building the rest of the site's pages. There are still some things that I'd like to implement which I
                know I can do with traditional JS, but I'm still puzzled as to how to inject custom code into a Webflow
                page. One step at a time though! </p>
            <p>This is still a WIP, but the site is already up and running. Check it out <a target="_blank"
